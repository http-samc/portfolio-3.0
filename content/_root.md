## hi 👋
I'm Sam, a student at [Fremd High School](https://adc.d211.org/Domain/9) ('23). I first started coding at 12 years old to kill free time, but it quickly became more than a hobby for me. Today, in addition to developing, I spend my time:
- debating [Public Forum](https://www.speechanddebate.org/topics/) on the IL and National Circuit
- swimming
- organizing hackathons
- working on research
- and going to school 🎒

## contact 🤝
I'm open for structured work, internships, freelance projects, and anything else that can help me better myself as a developer **and** a person. Feel free to reach out to me via email at [sam@chitgopekar.tech](mailto:sam@chitgopekar.tech), or via any of my other socials below.

## tech stack ⚙️
These are some of the technologies I look to when starting a new project. Though there's some overlap, I've always beleived that using the right tool for the right job is the most important aspect of software development.
