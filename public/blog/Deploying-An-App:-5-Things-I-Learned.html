<p>6 months ago, I set out to develop the perfect evidence procurement tool for High School Debate. That &#39;perfect tool&#39; happened to be Cuttr:
<a href="https://gyazo.com/585c01b237054e6aa99e89c9093727e7"><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/585c01b237054e6aa99e89c9093727e7.png" alt="Cuttr"></a>
Pretty quickly, some friends gave me their two cents and the program evolved into Cut-It. This was the first application I wanted to deploy to thousands of regular people. Here&#39;s what our latest beta version looked like:
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3rjej1yf0abx223li0yt.png" alt="Cut-It Beta">
Finally, this summer, after months of work, I launched Cut-It 1.0, our first release version. If you thought the jump from Cuttr to Cut-It beta was cool, check this out:
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68s3faqyz4imlfguhb3e.png" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>I&#39;m aware many of you have no idea what makes this project useful because High School Debate tech isn&#39;t exactly commonplace in dev circles. Luckily that&#39;s not the point of this post. When deploying Cut-It, I had to go through several hurdles and frankly, if I were rebuilding this project from scratch, I would do it completely differently. My advice should apply to anyone, so that&#39;s the point of this writeup.</p>
</details>
<br>

<p><strong>Obligatory Promotion: Cut-It is <a href="https://github.com/http-samc/cut-it">open-sourced</a> and we&#39;re looking for contributors! You can get it at <a href="http://cutit.cards">cutit.cards</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Before we start, let me briefly explain the tech stack for Cut-It:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project is written in Python</li>
<li>Qt (PyQt5) is used as a GUI framework (Cuttr used tkinter, though I quickly realized this was far too underpowered)</li>
<li>Binaries are built with PyInstaller</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, here&#39;s my advice:</p>
<h2 id="1-dont-use-python">1. Don&#39;t use Python.</h2>
<p>Although I like it&#39;s easy syntax, I found PyInstaller to be shaky at best. After working with Go (a compiled language), I got jealous of how easy it was to build and ship packages since it builds to a single binary. For reference, when I tried using the <code>--onefile</code> option with PyInstaller, it took me almost 20 seconds to run the program.</p>
<p>This comparsion might not be the fairest (Go is compiled, Python is interpreted), but the difference still stands. Even with other interpreted languages like Javascript, build processes still felt a lot cleaner. That could just be me, but regardless, I&#39;d still go with Go over Python - especially now that it seems to have well-developed (albeit unofficial) <a href="https://github.com/therecipe/qt">Qt bindings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-have-multiple-devices-ready">2. Have multiple devices ready.</h2>
<p>If you want to create a cross-platform desktop app, you&#39;re going to want to deploy on Windows and MacOS at a minimum, and probably Linux too. Windows and Linux are easy to do, but MacOS is a pain if you don&#39;t have a Mac. I tried using <a href="http://scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>, a Mac rental service, to rent a Mac to run PyInstaller on. It was a nightmare. The lag was unbearable and I had to end up building it on a friend&#39;s Macbook Air.</p>
<p>If you want to shell out $25/day (1 day minimum due to Apple&#39;s license) you can rent an instance from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/">AWS</a>. I&#39;d imagine the lag would be minimal, since the servers would be in the US whereas Scaleway&#39;s are all in Paris. This project is open sourced and has no sponsorships, so I really didn&#39;t want to spend hundreds of dollars a year just to build it for MacOS, which is why I just decided to buy a Mac. This way, I can run Windows 10 with <a href="https://support.apple.com/boot-camp">Bootcamp</a>, Linux, and OSX on the same device.</p>
<h2 id="3-keep-some-cash-on-you">3. Keep some cash on you.</h2>
<p>Even if you&#39;re keeping your project free, you&#39;re still going to have to pay $99/yr. for Apple&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/enroll/">Developer Program</a> to get a Mac certificate (albeit Apple&#39;s price also gets you access to deploy to the iOS and Mac App Stores, among other things) and about $100 to get a 1 yr. Windows certificate from a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/get-a-code-signing-certificate">provider</a>. I consider these to be investments in yourself as a developer rather than a particular project, so I register them under my name. This way, I don&#39;t have to buy new certificates anytime I want to distribute something (though if you&#39;re building a major application you might want to consider doing so).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is a nice-to-have feature if you&#39;re building for developers - most of us will know the pains of getting certificates and it won&#39;t significantly harm your downloads to users conversion factor. However, if you&#39;re considering deploying to the &#39;general population&#39;, it becomes a requirement if you want people to actually use your program - those warning messages can be concerning. MacOS doesn&#39;t even immediately present you with the option to open an unsigned file, which is why I&#39;d reccommend getting an OSX certificate through the Apple Developer Program over a Windows one if you have to pick.</p>
<h2 id="4-think-ahead">4. Think ahead.</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re going to be pushing any form of an update to your code, you need either an autoupdater or a built-in update notifier. Now the first option is still more difficult than it has to be - I haven&#39;t found a good cross platform autoupdater. I chose to implement a built-in update notifier instead. Here&#39;s a generic rundown of what I did:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">On start:
1. Poll the GitHub releases page (using the GitHub API) for the latest release
 - If the latest release version == the current software version, ignore the rest of these steps and load directly to the program
2. In the release description, check for a throwaway tag marked &#39;&lt;req&gt;&#39; signaling that the update is required
 - If the update is required, don&#39;t offer a &#39;Continue without Updating&#39; option
3. Find out what platform the code is running on
4. In the &#39;assets&#39; section of the release on GitHub, find the target installer (Windows: dist-win.msi, MacOS: dist-mac.pkg).
5. Set the &#39;Update Now&#39; button to open the &#39;browser_download_url&#39; of the appropriate installer
</code></pre>
<p>Just like that, you can use GitHub&#39;s Releases API to maintain control over your codebase. The format for accessing your releases through the api is: <code>https://api.github.com/repos/{USERNAME}/{REPO_NAME}/releases</code>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what <a href="https://api.github.com/repos/http-samc/cut-it/releases">https://api.github.com/repos/http-samc/cut-it/releases</a> looks like (various nonpretinent information omitted for brevity):</p>

<h2 id="5-know-how-to-build-installers">5. Know how to build installers.</h2>
<p>This one&#39;s simple. No one wants to go through the pain of downloading, unzipping, deleting and replacing your program files/assets every time they update or install. Once again, there&#39;s obviously no crossplatform solution to this, but unfortunately, it&#39;s something you need to do reagardless. I&#39;ll keep it quick with what I used (both are free):</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <a href="https://www.advancedinstaller.com/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=advancedinstaller&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl_SHBhCQARIsAFIFRVVsdjATYT_z4_JyATlznPCVGK8FiAmcnhu0XfWvjvLnchEXFsedpZgaAtTTEALw_wcB">Advanced Installer</a></li>
<li>MacOS: <a href="https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/pkgbuild/">pkgbuild</a> (this is built in and shockingly easy to use)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bonus-tip">Bonus Tip!!!</h2>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t build a desktop application.</strong> At least don&#39;t make it your go-to. After finishing up all of Cut-It&#39;s targeted functionality, I quickly realized the entire project could&#39;ve been implemented quicker in vanilla JavaScript. Looking back, I remember reading the Qt docs thinking &quot;What&#39;s the Qt method for <code>window.getSelection()</code>?&quot;.</p>
<p>I think the best way to build any GUI app is just with the HTML/CSS/JS stack. If you need a &quot;real&quot; desktop app (accesses filesystem, etc.), you can use a JS framework, with the most popular being <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>. I&#39;m reimplementing Cut-It as a vanilla JS site that&#39;s a progressive web app. These are being championed by lots of big companies, and you can read about how Google is doing so in Chrome (v.70+) <a href="https://www.simicart.com/blog/desktop-pwa/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This also solves the compilation and installer development issue. Because it&#39;s a web app, you never need an autoupdater. If you&#39;re using something like AWS Elsastic Beanstalk with their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/continuous-deployment-pipeline/">Code Pipeline</a> to host your site, you can just push to main and instantly update your user&#39;s apps. Moreover, you don&#39;t need to worry about paying for certificates.</p>
